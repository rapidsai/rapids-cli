    "cuDF is a Python GPU DataFrame library for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise
    manipulating data. cuDF also provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers &
    data scientists, so they can use it to easily accelerate their workflows without going into the
    details of CUDA programming. "

    "cuML is a Python GPU Machine Learning library that implement machine learning algorithms and mathematical primitives functions that share compatible APIs
    with other RAPIDS projects.  cuML allows users to run traditional tabular ML tasks on GPUs without going into the details of CUDA programming.
    In most cases, cuML's Python API matches the API from scikit-learn."
